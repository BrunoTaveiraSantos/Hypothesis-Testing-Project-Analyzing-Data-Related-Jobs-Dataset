# Hypothesis-Testing-Project-Analyzing-Data-Related-Jobs-Dataset

Hypothesis:

H0: There is no significant difference in salaries between people who changed jobs ≤ 3 times and people who changed jobs > 3 times.
H1: There is a significant difference in salaries between people who changed jobs ≤ 3 times and people who changed jobs > 3 times.
Description:
This hypothesis aims to investigate whether the number of job changes has a significant impact on salaries. It compares the average salaries of two groups: individuals who have changed jobs three times or less (group a) and individuals who have changed jobs more than three times (group b). The null hypothesis (H0) suggests that there is no significant difference in salaries between the two groups, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) proposes that there is a significant difference.

Hypothesis: Managerial Role and Gender Independence

Hypothesis:
H0: Being a manager is independent of gender.
H1: Being a manager is dependent on gender.
Description:
This hypothesis examines the relationship between managerial roles and gender. The null hypothesis (H0) suggests that there is no association between being a manager and gender, indicating that gender does not influence the likelihood of being in a managerial position. The alternative hypothesis (H1) posits that there is a dependence between managerial roles and gender, implying that gender influences the likelihood of occupying a managerial position.

Hypothesis: Work Hours in Big Cities

Hypothesis:
H0: People living in big cities work fewer hours.
H1: People living in big cities work more hours.
Description:
This hypothesis focuses on the relationship between the size of cities and work hours. The null hypothesis (H0) proposes that individuals residing in big cities work fewer hours than those in smaller cities or rural areas. Conversely, the alternative hypothesis (H1) suggests that people living in big cities work more hours than those in smaller cities or rural areas. By examining work hour data across different city sizes, this hypothesis aims to determine if city size influences work hours.
